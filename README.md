My portfolio project<br />

Hello, my name is Martin and this is my portfolio project. 
The plan is to create one new portfolio page every month. Either I'll start from scratch or I'll leave what I created unfinished on one page and I'll continue working on the project but on a new page. 

The project may last a year or many, but the goal is to in the end showcase my progress and display my skills for potential employers.
