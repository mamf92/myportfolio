  <p class="paragraph1">
    Hi, my name is Martin and I'm creating a new portfolio every month for the
    forseeable future.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    My goal is to start a new portfolio page every month, to see my progress
    and to show off my skills.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Not only do I want to learn how to style a website, I also want to create
    a timeline to show my progress.
  </p>

  <p> Just started a new learning cours. Check it out here at <a
      href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-css-flexbox-by-building-a-photo-gallery">
      freeCodeCamp</a></p>
  <br />
  <p>I also just completed a new learning course. The description reads: "Every HTML element is its own box â€“ with its
    own
    spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model.

    In this course, you'll use CSS and the Box Model to create your own Rothko-style rectangular art pieces." You can
    find it <a href="Basic projects/rothkopainting.html">here.</a> </p>

    Here are some other previous work I have done: <br />
    <a href="Basic projects/coloredmarkers.html">Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of
      Colored Markers</a>
    <br />
    "Learn Basic CSS by building a <a target="_blank" href="Basic projects/cafemenu.html">Cafe Menu</a> <br /> <br />

    Here is a link to a previous basic learning project I worked on with HTML from freeCodeCamp: <a
      href="Basic projects/CatPhotoApp.html">Cat Photo App</a> <br />
    Following this I created my own small project where you can contribute in settling the debate: <br /> <a
      target=_blank href="Basic projects/CatsVSDogs.html"> Are cats better than dogs?</a>
